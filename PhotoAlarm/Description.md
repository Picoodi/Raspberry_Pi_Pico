This is a little chocolate Burglar alarm for when you have siblings if you know what i mean. You have to play around with the amount of resistance of the Photoresistor.
Its the big number in the script like 50000 which has the unit Ohm and shows the amount of Resistance. It depends how much light your chocolate hiding place has.
Just lay your beloved candy onto the resitors and wait until the buzzer starts to beep as soon as your siblings try to steal what belongs to you.
